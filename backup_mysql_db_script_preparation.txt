Backup db procudure:
=======================

Create non sudo backup user 
sudo useradd -m backup

sudo passwd backup
pass: Password1!

As sudo create /opt/db/backup
chown backup:backup backup

In there create subfolders: mysqldump , scripts also accessible from backup user

Info for backup user
=====================
# https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html
'' mysqldump requires at least the SELECT privilege for dumped tables, SHOW VIEW for dumped views, TRIGGER for dumped triggers, LOCK TABLES if the --single-transaction option is not used, and (as of MySQL 8.0.21) PROCESS if the --no-tablespaces option is not used. Certain options might require other privileges as noted in the option descriptions.

To reload a dump file, you must have the privileges required to execute the statements that it contains, such as the appropriate CREATE privileges for objects created by those statements. ''

Connect to mysql and crete a backupuser acount
(https://www.itsupportwale.com/blog/creating-a-backup-user-with-read-only-permission-for-mysql-db/)
For the dev enviroment created user as follows (can backup any database):
CREATE USER 'backupuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
SET PASSWORD FOR 'backupuser'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password');
GRANT Lock tables ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT Select ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT Show view ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO backupuser@localhost;
GRANT Usage ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT Show databases ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT Reload ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';
GRANT TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'backupuser'@'localhost';


at home folder of backup user created .my.cnf file with following contents:
[mysqldump]
user = backupuser
password = password

Now change the file permission to 600 to prevent other user from reading it
chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf


Backup script
=================
-As backup user create script backupdb.sh at opt/db/backup/scrips (see backupdb.sh file)




CRONJOB
=========
As backup user execute crontab -e to open editor for crontab for backup user and add the following line to execute backup script daily at 1 o clock:
0 1 * * * /opt/db/backup/scripts/backupdb.sh >> /opt/db/backup/mysqldump/backup.log 2>&1



RESTORE DATABASE
================
Note: zcat command only displays contents of gz file without extracting. Same as gunzip -c command.
zcat dbname-2022-07-16_23-31.sql.gz | mysql -u 'restore' -p database

Help: How to extract gz
=====================
To unzip created gzip file gzip -v -d -k file2.gz (-k  which is preserve org file not working on servers we have so be carefull!)
